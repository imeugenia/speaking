## Planned talks

<details>
  <summary><b>State machine pattern in FE development</b></summary>
  State management is a hard problem in applications not only on a global but also on the component level. It happens that components are over-stacked with boolean variables like `isLoading` , `isError`, and so on. That makes logic convoluted and easy to cause a bug.

This talk is for frontend developers who want to try shifting their state management paradigm. You will learn about a finite state machine pattern, how to draw and program a state chart using vanilla JavaScript.

By the end of the talk, you will understand how to implement the UI component state in a more clean and bug-free way.

  <summary><b>Bootstrapping web performance culture</b></summary>
Bootstrapping a web performance culture is a long process that requires patience. I would like to share my personal journey of bringing web performance into the development process and raising awareness about it. I hope that sharing my struggles, learnings, and small successes will give you inspiration on how to pave the way to a healthy web performance culture in your organization. We will cover monitoring, automated testing, and some ideas on how to encourage engineers and communicate with product management.

    Web Performance Monitoring
  </summary>
  Web performance monitoring is a good first step in bootstrapping the web performance culture in your organization. However, there are so many monitoring metrics like Time to First Byte, First Contentful Paint, First Input Delay, etc. It is easy to get overwhelmed! During the talk we will speak about: - Why monitoring is important? - Which monitoring metrics to choose? - How to measure, visualize, and analyze the data?

    Finite State Machine on Frontend
  </summary>
 The finite state machine (FSM) is a 60-year-old Automata Theory concept that is widely used in electrical engineering, mathematics and… frontend development. Isn’t it surprising? When I attended Computer Science courses I thought I would never use such a concept as a web developer. Only a few years later, when I got a chance to work on a complex project with various user flows, I realized that using the FSM brings a big gain in building a predictable and scalable user interface.  
  
When preparing this talk I asked myself:  
- How might one benefit from implementing an FSM when building a user interface?  
- How to plan and implement an FSM?  
- How to test an FSM?  
  
In short, this talk will walk you through all the important aspects of using an FSM in your frontend project.
